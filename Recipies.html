    <td>1.In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, semolina and salt.
      Stir in the dried yeast (or crumble in the fresh yeast).
      Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in most of the water along with the olive oil.
      Bring the dough together with your hands or a wooden spoon.
      As the flour is incorporated, the dough will start to take shape.
     Add the remaining water if the dough feels tight or hard.</td>

       Cut off a small piece of the dough and stretch part of it as thinly as you can.
       If you can see the shadow of your fingers through the dough
       (the light should shine through the dough like a window pane) without it tearing, it is ready to prove.
